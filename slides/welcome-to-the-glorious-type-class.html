<h2>Welcome to the glorious type class</h2>

<p>
  type classes are defined as a tool to provide ad-hoc polymorphism. In parametric polymorphism, you define a method in a parameterized class, and it works, whatever the parameter.
</p>

<p>
In ad-hoc polymorphism, however, a function is implemented differently for different types of its arguments, like 1+2 and “x”+”y”.
