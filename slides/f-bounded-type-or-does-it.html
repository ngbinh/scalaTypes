<h2>Or does it?</h2>

<pre>
  <code data-trim>
class Mammal(val name: String) extends Pet[Mammal] {
  def renamed(newName: String) = new Mammal(newName)
}

class Monkey(name: String) extends Mammal(name)
// hmm, Monkey is a Pet[Mammal]?
  </code>
</pre>

It's always feel like we are almost there (but possibly can never be)
